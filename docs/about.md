The matter-web-nextjs Stack provides Templates and Plugins for starting and developing React Web projects.

The Next.js is a flexible React framework that provides building blocks for building fast web apps.

To achieve the goal of providing quick startup of React projects, the matter-web-nextjs Stack provides two main Templates:

The web-nextjs-app-template, which creates a Nextjs application to be used alone or connected to a microfrontend environment;

The web-react-appshell template, which creates a React shell application that can render other applications generated by the matter-web-react template.

Both web-react-app and web-react-appshell Templates are React applications with the styled-components component library and the routing react-router-dom system.

Both Templates come ready to run unit tests using the testing-library. In addition, they have eslint and prettier already configured to guarantee the code writing standard among developers.

The matter-web-react Stack has two Plugins that can be applied to both Templates mentioned above:

The beagle Plugin adds to the project the dependency and the required boilerplate from the library for Server Driven UI Beagle;

The deploy-aws Plugin adds the ability to create AWS and Github Actions resources to deploy to these resources.
